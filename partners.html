							<p class="aboutBio">Since fighting broke out in South Sudan in December, more than 1 million people fleeing the violence have been displaced within the country, and an additional 350,000 have fled to neighboring countries. Many camps and settlements have health clinics staffed with nurses, but the influx of people is overwhelming: There is little running water and clinics quickly run out of the most basic medicines. AmeriCares is providing emergency supplies to Uganda, where more than 100,000 South Sudanese have sought refuge from the fighting. AmeriCares and Uganda Baylor International Pediatric AIDS Initiative (BIPAI) are working with DayOne Response Inc. and distributing 200 DayOne Purification Waterbags for the South Sudanese refugees in West Nile and Kirtandongo. Providing a supply of 120,000 liters of clean drinking water for the South Sudanese refugees.</p>

							<p class="partnerName">CARE: Benin, Annual Flooding Emergency Response</p>
							<p class="aboutBio"> 
							From July to September 2013, torrential rain poured relentlessly in Niger, Mali and North Benin, causing the Niger River to burst its banks.  The river flooded the municipalities of Malanville and Karimama resulting in the loss of a means of subsistence, a lack of potable water, the displacement of thousands of people and a heightened risk for epidemics and waterborne diseases. There was an urgent need to provide immediate relief items for the affected communities. CARE Benin-Togo (CARE) has been leading disaster relief efforts to assist flood victims since 2008  and sought to capitalize on the acquired expertise to mitigate key challenges in meeting the WASH (Water, Hygiene and Sanitation), ES (Emergency Shelter) and Food needs. An effective WASH strategy is an essential part of disaster relief operations because water is the primary source of life. Disaster relief operations also become shorter in duration if waterborne illness can be prevented in the early stages. Even though water from the Niger River is turbid and contaminated, it is the main source of water for 80% of the communities,  so far as community water supply system is not developed. Subsequently, CARE brought together key members in the WASH and ES fields to explore innovative approaches to supplying safe water quickly and widely to the affected communities.</p> 

							<p class="aboutBio">CARE has tested the DayOne Response Purification Waterbag&trade; as the most innovative and practical solution. The DayOne Purification Waterbag&trade; (Waterbag), coupled with the P&amp;G&trade; Purifier of Water packets (P&amp;G-POW), provided all the essential functions of a municipal water system in a personal backpack: water collection, transport, treatment and hygienic storage. In addition, its micro filter ensures the removal of solid particles producing visibly clear purified water. In 2013 CARE partnered with DayOne Response (DayOne) to conduct a field study evaluating the Waterbag’s effectiveness in meeting post-crisis safe water needs. For the pilot study, DayOne granted 88 Waterbags for use by displaced households in Karimama and Malanville. During the pilot, selected households received training on operating the Waterbags and CARE evaluated the training and user uptake of the technology. The pilot study assessed the Waterbag’s usability, functionality and potential for improving existing practices in CARE’s relief efforts.</p>

							<p class="aboutBio">The pilot proved to be a great example of what can be achieved through cooperation, community involvement and dedicated resources. The DayOne Purification Waterbag was able to rapidly and effectively deliver clean drinking water during CARE’s disaster relief efforts in North Benin. The pilot participants were stunned by the rapid and visible purification of the water, and praised its portability and straightforward pictographic instructions. Moreover, when they observed the flocculation of sediment in the water, it raised awareness in the communities about the necessity of purifying water. Women and children were the primary users of the Waterbags and proved that a high level of education and literacy were not requisites to operate the Waterbag. The Waterbag is an innovation that offered the two communities a viable source of safe drinking water, the pilot’s success proved that the availability of safe drinking water addresses several major problems within the communities affected by recurring seasonal floods in North Benin.  Overall, the field deployment of DayOne Waterbags was a practical and rewarding approach to supplying safe water in the early stages of a disaster.</p>

The DayOne Purification Waterbag is part of World Vision’s larger programs in the area.

							<p class="partnerName">Giving Children Hope: Philippines, Typhoon Haiyan Disaster Response</p>
							<p class="aboutBio">Within days after Typhoon Haiyan hit the Philippines, Giving Children Hope (GCHope) was handing off DayOne Purification Waterbags&trade; to a flight crew and pilots heading to the Philippines. DayOne Response shipped the Waterbags to GCHope immediately, making it easy for GCHope to connect with pilots via AERObridge who were willing to take Waterbags as their own personal luggage. Once the Waterbags arrived in the Philippines, GCHope’s partner Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) picked them up and assisted in the distribution to the Filipino people.</p>

							<p class="aboutBio">In most of the communities ADRA has distributed GCHope’s supplies in, there is only one water source. People walk far distances and wait in long lines to get a clean shower and haul water back to their homes for cooking and drinking purposes. With the DayOne Purification Waterbags&trade; volunteers have been able to collect clean water and bring it to homes to refill their supplies. ADRA was told of a rural mountain village in Tabuelan that had yet to receive any type of humanitarian aid three months after the typhoon. These resilient people were stripping the bark from banana trees to drink the moisture that they could catch as their main source of water. ADRA was able to deliver DayOne Purification Waterbags to this overjoyed community.</p>

							<p class="aboutBio">The DayOne Purification Waterbag&trade; uses robust treatment processes, including the P&amp;G Purifier of Water sachets developed by Procter &amp; Gamble as part of the non-profit P&amp;G Children’s Safe Drinking Water Program. "The collaboration between Giving Children Hope, ADRA, P&amp;G, and DayOne Response was crucial in providing this immediate water provision to the communities who otherwise did not have access to clean water," said Tricia Compas-Markman, CEO of DayOne Response. This response also supported P&amp;G’s goal to deliver 2 billion liters of clean drinking water every year by 2020.</p>

							<p class="aboutBio">"DayOne Purification Waterbags&trade; are a great product – the size and flexibility allowed it to be transported to the Philippines quickly and efficiently," said Sean Lawrence, Executive Director at GCHope. "When the next natural disaster hits, GCHope knows that DayOne Response will deliver life saving water with a product that is versatile, giving us many options to get water to people that need it most."</p>

							<p class="partnerName">Adventist Development Relief Agency: Philippines, Typhoon Haiyan Disaster Response</p>
							<p class="aboutBio">The Adventist Development Relief Agency team deployed DayOne Purification Waterbags&trade; provided by Giving Children Hope immediately following Typhoon Haiyan. The Adventist Development Relief Agency team noticed while they were there that people were having to haul buckets and bottles to what limited clean water sources were nearby, where they would wait in line with dozens of other people trying to shower and collect drinking water; then they would have to haul their containers back home again. So the team started going up and down the streets with full DayOne Waterbags strapped to their backs, dispensing water at people's homes and at schools. They also visited a mountainous village in Tabuelan that still hadn't received any help three months after the typhoon and were thrilled to have the opportunity to deliver DayOne Waterbags for use by the people of the village. The government hasn't been able to put any kind of water project into place, so people had actually been cutting down banana trees and siphoning out the liquid to drink.</p>

International Medical Corps distributed the WaterBags through its mobile health services and provided a one-hour training on their use at each distribution point.</p>
