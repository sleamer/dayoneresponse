						<h2 class="center">TESTIMONIALS</h2>
						<p>Nicaragua (2009)<br>
						One participant explained, “I was a survivor of the 2007 floods here in Nicaragua and we were given buckets and chemicals to treat our water. After performing the treatment with this bag, I see that it prevents re-contamination of water and I would have liked to use this treatment over the buckets we were given.” User feedback was also incorporated into design improvements to steer continued prototype development.</p>

						<p>Thailand (2010)<br>
						The Waterbag was one of ten technologies evaluated by the U.S. Marine Corps Forces Pacific Experimentation Center and the Office of Naval Research in the joint exercise with the Thai military in Sattahip, Thailand. The assessment concluded "The Waterbag can produce drinkable water that meets the CHPPM requirements for US service personnel in a timely and low-cost manner from a fresh water source." The system is simple to use, lightweight, and produces water with an acceptable color and smell.</p>

						<p>Haiti (2011)<br>
						In partnership with LDS-Humanitarian Services and International Medical Corps over 200 Haitians participated in field testing. Haitians gave overwhelmingly positive feedback, including: treatment process can be visually confirmed, the Waterbag is easier to carry than buckets, and the built-in filter gives additional confidence in treatment.
						USA, US Marine Corps Demonstration (2012) DayOne Response was one of ten water companies invited to demonstrate technologies to the US Marine Corps.  Demonstrations included water treatment performance and user feedback and operation.
						(Note: Due to confidentiality agreement all results from this testing are confidential.)</p>

						<p>Philippines (2012)<br>
						LDS-Humanitarian Services evaluated the DayOne WaterbagTM system in disaster prone communities in the Philippines.  The local communities provided positive feedback, including user confidence in the durability of the system and ease of use with support from the pictographic instructions.  Continued evaluation is ongoing by LDS-Humanitarian Services in other communities in Pakistan, Cambodia, and Vietnam.</p>

						<p>Uganda (2013)<br>
						Doctors without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) evaluated the DayOne WaterbagTM system in Uganda particular to Lake Victoria as it is full of the parasitic disease Bilharzia. The participants provided positive feedback including portability, durability, and ease of use.</p>

						<p>USA, US Naval Postgraduate School’s Joint Interagency Field Experimentation Program Under Sponsorship of the Office of Secretary of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security (2013)<br>
						DayOne Response was the only water company invited to demonstrate at the event.  100% of participants said there is a benefit to the DayOne Purification technology. Participants recommended the DayOne Waterbag be used in immediate Humanitarian Assistance / Disaster Relief (HR/DR) events and for the U.S. Military in austere environments. Participants recommended deployment worldwide where clean drinking water is not available.</p>

						<p>Liberia (2013)<br>
						Team Rubicon completed a trial of the DayOne Waterbag in Foya, Liberia with three locals and provided 100% positive evaluation. The participants liked that you could not only visually see the clean water but also knowing there was an additional filter added a greater sense of comfort and confidence for the users. Director of Field Operations at Team Rubicon said ”I would recommend deployment of the Waterbag to any 3rd world mission where the quality of water is even the slightest bit questionable.”</p>
